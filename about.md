There was I time when I wrote a couple of articles for the publication of [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) - an organization that still stays close to my heart.

By the time I joined FreeCodeCamp I was focusing on improving my data analytics / data manipulation capabilities. I was learning javascript to get into D3.js, while expanding my existing abilities with Python. I hated Javascript, by the way...

Not a surprise, I wanted to write articles and blogs with data-centred information.

It was a time in which I started to ask myself about better ways to deliver information that carries impact. Then I found Mike Bostock blogs, some Kaggle reports, Pudding (wauw!), New York Times and Bloommerg graphics, one or another losely but astonishing work here and there... some of them deliverying information almost in artistic way, full of interactivity and visuals.

Moreover: I found that the world was not only D3.js, and learned about other similar libraries, then also the canvas API, Three.js and WebGl, Augmented Reality... I was also into Machine Learning, so R and all those visualization tools from Python... I then started using Jupyter frequently (the closest to storytelling I could get), and one of the first to register in [Observable](https://observablehq.com/explore).

Meanwhile, I was publishing for FreeCodeCamp on [Medium](https://medium.com/). And although by that time I already started to recognize **the importance of content-over-form** (yeah... not always the most beautiful sites are the most read), I still felt a bit dissapointed - I wanted to add more interactivity to what I wrote.

...


Well... this is my attempt to get a bit closer to the way I would like to write my stories. I have been after something like that for a while. For long time. Really: I can not stop coming back to those other sites and still not feeling impressed. They really left a mark on me.

# So what is this project about?

The primary focus of this project is other people's code and the idea is to take those scripts and evaluate them with a divulgative and educative purpose. This was a relatively easy decision. I have been involved with organizations that relate to e-learning. FreeCodeCamp, [TechGrounds](https://techgrounds.nl/academy/) and more recently [Winc Academy](https://www.wincacademy.nl/). Then I have been also influenced by projects like [Brilliant.org](https://brilliant.org/courses/), to mention just one.

This is also a prove of concept right from the start. Admittedly, I don't expect this to be the work of a master coder, UX/UI expert nor a writer. It is just responding that "what if...". However, I am taking seriously the evolution of the project into something more "formal", by identifying improvements, automations, and inserting best practices while the project evolves - however far it goes.

# Technology selection

This project starts making use of [jekyllrb.com](https://jekyllrb.com/) [minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) and runs on github-pages. The reason is just convenience. I was looking for something that gave me the flexibility that I was looking for and jekyll was right there. It is true that it is a sort of "death framework walking" but, actually, I feel really comfortable with it. I might change it into something more modern in due time, but right now it was the most low-entry barrier framework.

I am also using other technologies, like [scrollama](https://github.com/russellsamora/scrollama) to standardize the storytelling implementations. The same as jekyll, it feels easy.
