# Thanks for landing here.

**Re-Versing** is about that - reverse-engineering some scripts, mostly visualization and animations I have been coming across during my time learning to code.

This blog focuses mostly on Javascript. There will be a bit a old fashion code as there are a some projects dating to the times of ES5.

I hope you don't mind.

> That is because the actual purpose of this blog is to get into the coding tricks of those who made those projects.

Thinks that I would certainly explore are projects in D3.js, Three.js, plain Javascript, probably some WebGL and CSS.

This blog intents to be a bit different to similar projects not necessarily in the content, as there are many similar proposals of looking into existing codes, but in its presentation:

> I will try interactive and visual tools to point out what made the reversed codes so attractive to me.

Hope you like what find!
