# Thanks for landing here.

Re-Versing is about that - reverse-engineering some beautiful projects I have been founding on the web during my time learning to code.

This blog focuses mostly on Javascript. There will be a bit a old fashion Javascript or any other language as there are projects dating to the times of ES5 (I hope you don't mind). At the end the whole purpose of this blog is to get into the minds of those who made those projects.

This intents to be a bit different to similar projects not necessarily in the content, as there are many similar proposals of looking into existing codes, but in its presentation: I will try to use more interactive and visual tools to point out what made the reversed codes so attractive to me.

Hope you like what find!

Regards,

Evaristo
