# graph-scroll.js is a good storytelling tool for D3.js projects

[**graph-scroll.js**](https://github.com/1wheel/graph-scroll) is another storytelling (scrolling) tool that took my attention. It is a work started by [Adam Pierce (1wheel)](https://github.com/1wheel) around 2016. It includes other 3 contributors, between them the leader of the **scrollama** project, Russell Samora.

One possible issue? The last maintenance was in 2020.

It claims to be based on [**stack.js**](https://github.com/mbostock/stack) which is a project started by the all-mighty Mike Bostock some time about 2010 with the eventual contribution of many others. However, that project is not maintained since 2015.

Both projects, **stack.js** and **graph-scroll.js** focus on D3.js and have good demos.

Here is the link to the **graph-scroll.js** demo: http://1wheel.github.io/graph-scroll/

And here the one to **stack.js** demo: https://mbostock.github.io/stack/

I would keep short this post because the **graph-scroll.js** demo is very good at indicating how to use the tool, so I wouldn't try to re-invent the Adam Pierce's 1-Wheel.

Check this project if you are looking for a scrolling event handler specifically for D3.js! Happy coding!
